Please make a note that the Whitman's Manuscripts `subCategory` goes by `transcriptions` NOT by `manuscripts`.


__NOTE: Do not update the repository from Cocoon files__! There is a specific set of files which should be publically available and they have been carefully curated in the data repository.
