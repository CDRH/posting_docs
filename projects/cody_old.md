<p>This is the currently active version of the Cody Archive, which is a partnership with the Buffalo Bill Center of the West. In the near future it will be replaced by a Rails application.</p>

<p>This application has an unusual aspect, which is that if you are changing the personography, you will need to break and hard refresh the file creating JSON from a faceted response from Solr.</p>
